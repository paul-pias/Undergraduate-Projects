This was my first undergraduate project under Ishtiaque Hossain Sir.

In this project i tried to make a simple virtual guitar using Codeblocks in C.
For this I used winmm library to load the audio files in Codeblocks and used gcc compiler to compile.

First I recorded down and up stroke for all 7 major and minor chords then assigned each stroke to a particular key. When someone try to play guitar he or she just has to press the keys accordingly.
