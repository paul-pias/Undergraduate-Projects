# Determination of Academic Performance and Academic Consistency using Fuzzy Logic

### The basic idea for doing this work was to propose a model using fuzzy logic using which a student can judge his or her current performance and also evaluate the parameters to considers that he or she should consider to maintain the desired result.

#### Method Used
- Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System
- K means algorith to calculate the consistency of the students

#### Input Parameters

- Number of Courses
- Hours of Study per day
- Average GPA of last three semesters
- Teaching Expectancy
- Attendance
- Online Assistence
- Hours in Part Time Job per week
- Hours in Social Media per Day
- Depression Level
- Competency in English

#### Output Parameters
 - CGPA

### Our work got selected in the 2018 International Conference on Intelligent System (IS)
