<h1 id="3"> 3. External Interface Requirements </h1><br>

<h2 id="3.1"> 3.1 User Interfaces </h2>
<p>ForRent.com is to have a sidebar present in all windows which will be the main controls for the user to navigate the site. The sidebar will contain filtered seach fields for Maximum Rent, Total Area (in Square Feet), Listing Type (Room/Flat), Number of Bedrooms and Location of the apartment.</p>

<p>ForRent.com is a website that can be accessible by virtually every web browser. Smoothness of the user interface will vary according to the quality of the internet connection and the download and upload speeds of the device that the website is being accessed with.</p>

<h2 id="3.3"> 3.3 Software Interfaces </h2>
<p>The front-end of ForRent.com will be made using jQuery and a bootstrap template of a typical e-commerce site and a MySQL database will be made in phpmyadmin. The front-end and the back-end will then be connected using the CodeIgniter framework, which utilizes the MVC pattern. MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It helps to connect the front-end and back-end of a website or web application by organising the codes into three interconnected parts. The database is managed in the Model section, the front-end code is managed by the View section and finally the php code that connects the database to the front-end is managed by the Controller section. The resulting application will then hosted be on a server. Initial testing will be done by hosting on a XAMPP Local Server.</p>

<h2 id="3.4"> 3.4 Communication Interfaces </h2>
<p>POST methods will be instead of GET methods to pass data to and from the server as it is more secure. POST does not disclose username and password in the URLs.</p>
<p>Users can choose to directly sign up and log into ForRent.com, which will then send the data directly to our database or they can choose to sign in with their existing Facebook/Google accounts, which will be facilitated with the respective APIs.</p>
